Predictive Policing: Leveraging Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Crime Data Analysis
This project aims to enhance crime data analysis by integrating both machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project involves:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature selection from raw crime data.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms to predict crime occurrences.
Deep Learning Models: Utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for complex pattern recognition in crime data.
Evaluation and Comparison: Detailed analysis of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Comprehensive visual representations of data and model outputs for better interpretation.
The tools and technologies used include Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data handling, model building, and visualization.
